We're gonna be riding the bleeding edge with one of the newest Linux distros:
Asahi Linux! It's the only Linux distro purposefully designed to work on the 
Apple M1 and M2 chips found in MacBooks. One of the biggest barriers to entry
is switching over to using it; with Asahi Linux, you can have your usual MacOS
_and_ Asahi installed!
