This is just a short blog post going over a few of the command-line tools some of the members of the group use and enjoy.

## nobodywasishere

[`z`](https://github.com/rupa/z/):
: This program essentially does fuzzy-cd, meaning after having it installed for about a week, I'm able to just type the name of the folder I went to last week and it will jump there.

[`blog`](https://github.com/nobodywasishere/blog/):
: This is a small python script I wrote that allows me to take notes on a reoccurring subject effortlessly, just by doing `blog <topic>`. It will reopen the old note or create a new one, and uses your default `EDITOR`; plus, I have it setup to save directly to the `_drafts` folder of my blog

## gnu

[`McFly`](https://github.com/cantino/mcfly):
: A small neural network based method for searching through a shellâ€™s history (bonus points for being written in rust). There are lots of factors that the command takes into account when recalling previous commands which makes it more helpful than standard autocomplete functionality.

[`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/):
: A quick method for opening local ports to the internet for web(hook)/application/API testing. I often use this for communicating quickly with embedded devices. 

[`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd):
: Similar to the find command but much more user friendly. Text highlighting definitely helps to view the output more easily. It also already ignores files mentioned in a `.gitignore` file which makes it useful for avoiding excess clutter.

[`nano`](https://github.com/madnight/nano):
: A simple, lightweight CLI text editor that is rich with helpful features such as text search, cut, paste, save, etc. Comes preinstalled on most machines.

## Edward Ned Harvey

[`ncdu`](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu):
: Useful for scanning a directory to find out what's hogging the disk

## io_stream

[`diff-so-fancy`](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy):
: Good looking diffs

[`htop`](https://htop.dev/):
: Like top, but easier to see

[`ssh-copy-id`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-copy-id):
: Copies the contents of your public_key file directly into authorized keys on a remote server
